macchina lets you view system information, like your kernel version, uptime,
memory usage, processor load and much more. macchina is basic by default and
extensible by design.

If you're interested in the library macchina uses to fetch system information,
have a look at libmacchina; fetching-related issues should be filed on that
repository.
