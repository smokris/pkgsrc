$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.2 2021/09/21 12:23:49 bouyer Exp $

The Xen hypervisor is installed under the following locations:
	${XENKERNELDIR}/xen.gz		(standard hypervisor)
	${XENKERNELDIR}/xen-debug.gz	(debug hypervisor)

Note that unlike upstream Xen, pv-linear-pt defaults to true.
You can disable it using pv-linear-pt=false on the Xen command line,
but then you can't boot NetBSD in PV mode.

Unlike upstream Xen, 32bits PV guests support is eanbled by default, but
this is not security-supported any more, and will be disabled in the
next pkgsrc release. Switch to pvshim (for netbsd-9 or older) or pvh
(for netbsd-current).
