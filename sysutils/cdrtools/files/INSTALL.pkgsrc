The location of the @PKGNAME_NOREV@ `defaults' file has been set to:

   @PKG_SYSCONFDIR@/cdrecord

This is the pkgsrc standard config file location, NOT the @PKGNAME_NOREV@
standard location, which is /etc/default/cdrecord.

The reason for this is that pkgsrc packages should not use configuration
files outside @LOCALBASE@ unless they are explicitly set by the user.


You will need to stop Solaris volume management before using @PKGNAME_NOREV@:

    /etc/init.d/volmgt stop
