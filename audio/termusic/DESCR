Terminal Music Player written in Rust.

Listen to music freely as both in freedom and free of charge!

Freedom: As time goes by, online service providers controls pretty much
everything we listen. Complicated copyright issues make things worse.
If my favorite song cannot be found in a website, probably I'll just not listen
to them for years.

Free of charge: you can download from youtube, netease,migu and kugou for free.
No need to register monthly paid membership for several websites.

As a contributor of GOMU, I met serious problems during development. The main
problem is data race condition. So I basically rewrite the player in rust, and
hope to solve the problem.

As for now, mp3, m4a, flac, wav and ogg/vorbis are supported.
By the way, for mobile devices, I recommend sync your music library with mobile
by verysync and listen to them with vinyl(which I contributed also).

If you wish to download mp3 from youtube, install youtube-dl.
