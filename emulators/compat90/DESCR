This package supplies the shared library files needed to run dynamically
linked executables compiled under NetBSD 9.0 on a later NetBSD.
The shared libraries for 'native' X11 are integrated.

This package is bridging the gap to NetBSD 10; since the latter is
still in beta at the time of creating this package, the package may
be incomplete.
