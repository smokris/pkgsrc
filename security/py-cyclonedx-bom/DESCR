This project provides a runnable Python-based application for
generating CycloneDX bill-of-material documents from either:

* Your current Python Environment

* Your project's manifest (e.g. Pipfile.lock, poetry.lock or
  requirements.txt)

* Conda as a Package Manager

The BOM will contain an aggregate of all your current project's
dependencies, or those defined by the manifest you supply.

CycloneDX is a lightweight BOM specification that is easily created,
human-readable, and simple to parse.
