shod is a multi-monitor floating reparenting X11 window manager that
supports tiled and tabbed containers.  shod sets no keybindings, reads
no configuration, and works only via mouse with a given key modifier
(Alt by default) and by responding to client messages sent by the shodc
utility (shod's remote controller).

shod was inspired by the following programs and window managers.  I'd
like to thank their authors for their work that helped me developing
shodi; notion, wmii, acme.

shod was developed after studying the code of the following window
managers.  I'd like to thank their authors for their work that helped
me understanding how a X Window Manager works; dwm, katriawm.
