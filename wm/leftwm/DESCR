Left is a tiling window manager written in rust for stability and performance.
The core of left is designed to do one thing and one thing well. Be a window
manager.
Because you probably want more than just a black screen LeftWM is built around
the concept of theming. With themes you can choose between different
bar/compositor/background/colors, whatever makes you happy.

LeftWM has been built from the very beginning to support multiple screens and
has been built around ultrawide monitors. You will see this with the default
key bindings.
